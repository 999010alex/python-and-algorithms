# Exercises - Intro to Data Types

# Code the following and add a comment for each line of code
# Upload the file to your Github account in a repository called
# Python - data types

'''
Exercise #1
Suppose you have $100, which you can invest with a 10% return each year.
After one year, it's 100×1.1=110 dollars, and after two years
it's 100×1.1×1.1=121.
Use Python's print() function
to calculate how much money you end up with after 7 years.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exercise #2
Create a variable called savings and equal to 100. 
Create a variable factor, equal to 1.10.
Use savings and factor to calculate the amount of money you end up with
after 7 years. Store the result in a new variable, result.
Print out the value of result.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exercise #3

Create a new string, desc, with the value "compound interest".
Create a new boolean, profitable, with the value True

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exercise #4

Find the type of the following variables used in the exercises 1-3 :
savings, factor, 'compound interest'and profitable.
Have Python output each data type. 

Exercise #5
Let's combine date types.
Add a message that prints the following: 'I started with $( insert your
savings variable) and now I have $( result variable). Great!'
